## About

CNGM is the desktop half of the **Cafe Neurotico ecosystem** — detail-focused, neurotic about your library, and built to handle all the heavy lifting. It imports your entire game collection from Steam, Heroic (Epic, GOG, Amazon Games), and beyond, then lets you perfect every entry with custom artwork, YouTube trailers, ProtonDB ratings, HLTB data, and rich metadata scraped from Steam and IGDB.

Everything lives in a single portable `GameManagerConfig` folder. Back it up, move it to a new machine, and your entire curated library travels with it — covers, logos, trailers, screenshots and all.

> Pair it with **[CREMA](https://github.com/shampoo-is-a-lie/CREMA)** — the fullscreen, gamepad-driven companion app. Place both AppImages in the same folder and they share the same library automatically.

## Installation

1. Download the latest `CNGM.AppImage` from the [Releases](https://github.com/shampoo-is-a-lie/CafeNeuroticoGameManager/releases) page.
2. Make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x CNGM.AppImage
   ```
3. Run it:
   ```bash
   ./CNGM.AppImage
   ```

On first launch, CNGM creates a `GameManagerConfig` folder in the same directory. All your data stays there — no hidden system folders.

**Adding CREMA:** place `CREMA.AppImage` in the same folder as `CNGM.AppImage`. A *Go Fullscreen With CREMA* button appears automatically at the bottom of the sidebar.

**Desktop integration:** open CNGM, go to **Tools → System → Add to Application Menu** to register both apps in your desktop launcher (GNOME, KDE, XFCE…) with icons. No terminal required.

## Requirements

- Linux (x86_64)
- [Heroic Games Launcher](https://heroicgameslauncher.com/) for Epic / GOG / Amazon sync *(optional)*
- A free Steam Web API key for Steam library import *(optional)*
- A free IGDB / Twitch dev key for enriched metadata *(optional)*
- A free SteamGridDB API key for custom artwork *(optional)*
